Data Analytics App

Python-Based Data Analytics Application Deployment

Objective

The aim of this project is to create a Python-based data analytics application and set up a fully automated CI/CD pipeline. This pipeline will handle building, testing, deploying, and monitoring the application with tools like Docker, Kubernetes (Minikube), and Jenkins.

Technologies Used
Version Control: GitHub
Containerization: Docker
Orchestration: Minikube (Kubernetes)
CI/CD Tool: Jenkins
Testing Tools: Pytest, Selenium (optional for UI testing)
Configuration Management: Ansible or Chef
Monitoring: AWS CloudWatch (optional)
Steps to Complete the Project
1. GitHub Setup
Create a GitHub repository to host the project.
Set up folders for source code, tests, data, Kubernetes manifests, and documentation.
Add a sample dataset in the data folder.
2. Develop the Python Application
Build a Python application with modular, reusable code.
Use a virtual environment to manage dependencies.
Implement key data analytics features.
3. Containerization
Write a Dockerfile to containerize the app using a lightweight Python base image.
Include dependencies and ensure the application is ready to deploy.
4. CI/CD Pipeline with Jenkins
Automate the workflow with Jenkins:
Build the Python app and install dependencies.
Run unit tests to ensure correctness.
Build and push the Docker image.
Deploy the app to Kubernetes.
5. Testing
Write unit tests with Pytest to validate the analytics functionality.
Optionally, write Selenium tests for any web-based interfaces.
6. Deploy with Minikube
Deploy the app to a local Kubernetes cluster using Minikube.
Write Kubernetes manifests for deployment and services.
7. Configuration Management
Use Ansible or Chef to automate server and app setup tasks.
Set up Docker, Kubernetes, and deploy manifests.
8. Monitoring (Optional)
Set up AWS CloudWatch to monitor the application.
Visualize performance metrics and logs.
